# Tech Choices and Architecture Rationale

This document summarizes the major technologies, frameworks, libraries, and services used across the Lumora codebase, with interview-ready justifications, trade-offs, architectural roles, and future considerations.

## Node.js + Express 5 (Backend API)

- Why it was a good fit
  - Lightweight, flexible HTTP framework with a rich middleware ecosystem
  - Fast developer iteration; simple to model REST endpoints for journals, chat, goals, auth
  - Works well with JavaScript end-to-end (frontend + backend)
- Alternatives considered
  - NestJS: opinionated, DI + decorators; heavier scaffold for a small team
  - Fastify: faster baseline but fewer built-in examples/ecosystem familiarity
  - Next.js API routes: tied to React app, we preferred a separate backend
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Minimal structure requires discipline around architecture and conventions
  - Express 5 (latest) introduces subtle breaking changes during migration
- Architectural role & interactions
  - Hosts controllers (`auth`, `journal`, `chat`, `goal`) and middleware (`auth`)
  - Integrates cron jobs, AI adapters (Cohere, Pinecone, Groq), email service, and MongoDB via Mongoose
- Future considerations
  - Consider NestJS if team scales and needs opinionated modules/testing patterns
  - Add rate limiting (Express middleware + Redis) and structured logging

## MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose (Database & ODM)

- Why it was a good fit
  - Flexible document model for journal entries, chat sessions, and user profiles
  - Mongoose schemas/validators simplify data modeling and relationships
- Alternatives considered
  - PostgreSQL + Prisma: strong relational integrity; heavier upfront schema planning
  - DynamoDB: scalable but requires careful partition design; less friendly for ad hoc queries
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Complex relational queries are less ergonomic vs SQL
  - ODM abstraction sometimes hides driver-level performance tuning
- Architectural role & interactions
  - Models: `User`, `JournalEntry`, `ChatSession`, `MemorySnapshot`
  - Controllers orchestrate CRUD, streak logic, goal state, and selection for reminders
- Future considerations
  - Add indexes for frequent queries (date ranges, userId)
  - Consider PostgreSQL for analytics; keep MongoDB for content

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Auth

- Why it was a good fit
  - Stateless authentication enables simple horizontal scaling
  - Easy to integrate with frontend via `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Alternatives considered
  - Session-based auth (express-session + Redis): server memory + infra overhead
  - OAuth providers: overkill for email/password + OTP flow
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Token revocation is non-trivial; must manage expiry and rotation
- Architectural role & interactions
  - `middleware/auth.js` verifies tokens and attaches `req.user`
  - Secures journal, chat, goals, and profile endpoints
- Future considerations
  - Add refresh tokens and key rotation; consider JTI allowlist on logout

## Bcrypt (Password Hashing)

- Why it was a good fit
  - Battle-tested library for hashing passwords with salt
- Alternatives considered

  - Cloud schedulers (Cloud Scheduler/CloudWatch): external dependency + setup
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Single-process cron lacks distributed coordination/failover
- Architectural role & interactions
  - Triggers `reminderService.sendDailyReminders()` every 5 minutes (IST)
  - Pulls goal state and emails users as needed
- Future considerations
  - Move to a worker + queue for reliability and observability; add distributed locks

## Nodemailer (Email Sending)

- Why it was a good fit
  - Direct SMTP support; flexible transporter config (custom SMTP + Gmail fallback)
  - Fine-grained control over retries, timeouts, TLS
- Alternatives considered
  - SendGrid/Postmark/SES SDKs: managed deliverability and dashboards; paid/vendor lock-in
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Must manage deliverability and reputation ourselves; less insight than managed ESPs
- Architectural role & interactions
  - `emailService.js` builds transporters and handles retries/backoff
  - Used by reminder service and OTP flows with HTML templates
- Future considerations
  - Switch to SES/SendGrid for scale, analytics, bounce handling, and compliance

## Axios (HTTP Client)

- Why it was a good fit
  - Promise-based HTTP client with clean interceptors, used for AI and Pinecone APIs

  - Robust timezone handling (IST) and date math for streaks, reminders, trends
- Alternatives considered
  - Luxon/Day.js: viable; team had existing moment-timezone utilities
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Mixing libraries requires consistency rules to avoid subtle bugs
- Architectural role & interactions
  - Back-end uses moment-timezone for IST windows; front-end uses date-fns(-tz) for display
- Future considerations
  - Consolidate on one library (e.g., date-fns-tz) to reduce mental overhead

## ESLint (Linting)

- Why it was a good fit
  - Enforces consistency and catches common pitfalls in React/Node

  - Types available for React/Vite; incremental typing potential without full conversion
- Alternatives considered
  - Full TS migration: more effort; phased approach chosen
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Limited type safety across the app until full migration
- Architectural role & interactions
  - Present in devDeps; not enforced in runtime code yet
- Future considerations
  - Gradual migration of models, controllers, and hooks to TS

## dotenv + CORS (Infra Plumbing)

- Why it was a good fit
  - `.env` for secrets; CORS for local dev (`5173` â‡„ `3000`)
- Alternatives considered
  - Config services (Vault/SSM): heavier ops; not needed initially
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Manual secret management; risk if not standardized across environments
- Architectural role & interactions

  - Full control over branding and responsive layouts for OTP and reminders
- Alternatives considered
  - Template services (MJML, SendGrid templates): reduces control but increases velocity
- Trade-offs accepted
  - Manual CSS-inlined layouts and testing across clients
- Architectural role & interactions
  - `otp.js` and `notification.js` produce HTML consumed by `emailService`
- Future considerations
  - Adopt MJML or an ESP template system for iteration and A/B testing

## Overall Architecture Notes

- SPA frontend (React/Vite) talking to a stateless API (Express/JWT)
- MongoDB as system of record; Pinecone as vector search index; AI adapters (Cohere/Groq) for RAG
- Cron-based reminder subsystem invoking email infrastructure
- Clear separation of concerns: controllers, AI adapters, services, utils, models

## Future Platform Considerations

- Add Redis for caching, rate limiting, and queues (BullMQ) for reminders/AI tasks
- Observability: request tracing, metrics, and structured logs across AI calls
- Security: token rotation, per-user Pinecone filtering/namespacing, secret management
- CI/CD: lint/test pipelines, containerization, and environment promotion
- Testing: unit for controllers/services, integration for AI adapters with mocks
