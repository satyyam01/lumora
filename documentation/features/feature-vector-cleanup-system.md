# Vector Cleanup System

## Feature Overview
The Vector Cleanup System is a comprehensive data consistency mechanism that ensures proper cleanup of vector embeddings from Pinecone when user data is deleted. It addresses the critical data inconsistency issue between MongoDB and Pinecone databases, ensuring that deleted content is truly removed from all systems for privacy compliance and resource optimization.

## Problem Solved

### Data Inconsistency Issue
**Before**: When users deleted journal entries or accounts, only MongoDB data was cleaned up, leaving orphaned vectors in Pinecone that:
- Created data inconsistency between databases
- Allowed deleted content to remain searchable
- Consumed unnecessary storage resources
- Violated privacy requirements (GDPR compliance)

**After**: Complete cleanup across both MongoDB and Pinecone ensures:
- Data consistency between all systems
- True deletion of user content
- Resource optimization
- Privacy compliance

## Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Vector Cleanup Utilities (`server/utils/vectorCleanup.js`)
**Purpose**: Centralized vector deletion functions
**Functions**:
- `deleteUserVectorsFromPinecone(userId, namespace)` - Bulk user cleanup
- `deleteVectorByEntryId(entryId, namespace)` - Individual entry cleanup

**Features**:
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Namespace support for multi-tenant deployments
- Consistent API patterns with legacy system
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

#### 2. Controller Integration
**Account Deletion** (`server/controllers/authController.js`):
```javascript
// Delete Pinecone vectors
try {
  await deleteUserVectorsFromPinecone(userId);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Pinecone delete error:', err.message);
}
```

**Entry Deletion** (`server/controllers/journalController.js`):
```javascript
// Delete corresponding vector from Pinecone
try {
  await deleteVectorByEntryId(entry._id.toString());
} catch (vectorError) {
  console.error('Failed to delete vector:', vectorError);
}
```

#### 3. LangGraph Integration
**Current State**: LangGraph handles vector creation/upserting but not deletion
**Rationale**: Separation of concerns - AI processing vs. data cleanup
**Benefits**: 
- Cleaner LangGraph workflows focused on AI processing
- Centralized cleanup logic in utilities
- Independent error handling for different concerns

## Migration from Legacy AI System

### Before Migration
**Legacy AI System** (`server/ai/` folder):
- `cohere.js` - Text embedding functions
- `pinecone.js` - Vector operations (including deletion)
- `llm.js` - Language model integration
- `summarize.js` - Journal summarization

**Issues**:
- Mixed concerns (AI processing + data cleanup)
- Conditional logic based on `LLM_ENGINE` environment variable
- Duplicate functionality between legacy and LangGraph systems
- Complex dependency management

### Migration Process

#### Step 1: LangGraph Implementation
- Implemented `summarizeGraph.js` for journal processing
- Implemented `chatGraph.js` for chat functionality
- Replaced manual AI pipeline with structured workflows
- Added proper error handling and validation

#### Step 2: Controller Cleanup
**Journal Controller**:
- Removed all legacy AI imports (`../ai/summarize`, `../ai/cohere`, `../ai/pinecone`, `../ai/llm`)
- Removed conditional logic for `LLM_ENGINE === 'langgraph'`
- Kept only LangGraph-based summarization
- Removed legacy `chatWithJournal` function

**Chat Controller**:
- Removed all legacy AI imports
- Simplified to use only `chatGraph.invoke`
- Removed complex prompt building and context assembly
- Maintained session CRUD operations

#### Step 3: Vector Cleanup Extraction
**Created** `server/utils/vectorCleanup.js`:
- Extracted `deleteUserVectorsFromPinecone` from legacy `ai/pinecone.js`
- Added `deleteVectorByEntryId` for individual entry cleanup
- Maintained same API patterns for compatibility
- Added comprehensive error handling

#### Step 4: Integration
**Account Deletion**:
- Added vector cleanup to `authController.deleteAccount`
- Maintained error handling so deletion continues even if vector cleanup fails
- Ensured complete data removal for privacy compliance

**Entry Deletion**:
- Added vector cleanup to `journalController.deleteEntry`
- Implemented individual vector deletion by entry ID
- Maintained user experience (deletion succeeds even if vector cleanup fails)

### After Migration
**Clean Architecture**:
- LangGraph handles AI processing workflows
- Controllers handle CRUD operations
- Utilities handle cross-cutting concerns (vector cleanup)
- No dependencies on legacy `ai` folder

## Technical Implementation

### Vector Cleanup Functions

#### `deleteUserVectorsFromPinecone(userId, namespace)`
**Purpose**: Bulk deletion of all vectors for a user
**Use Case**: Account deletion
**Implementation**:
```javascript
const response = await axios.post(
  `${PINECONE_HOST}/vectors/delete`,
  {
    filter: { userId },
    namespace,
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'Api-Key': PINECONE_API_KEY,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  }
);
```

#### `deleteVectorByEntryId(entryId, namespace)`
**Purpose**: Individual vector deletion
**Use Case**: Single entry deletion
**Implementation**:
```javascript
const response = await axios.post(
  `${PINECONE_HOST}/vectors/delete`,
  {
    ids: [entryId],
    namespace,
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'Api-Key': PINECONE_API_KEY,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  }
);
```

### Error Handling Strategy
**Graceful Degradation**: Vector deletion failures don't block user operations
**Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
**User Experience**: Users see successful deletion even if vector cleanup fails
**Monitoring**: Errors are logged for operational monitoring

### Data Flow

#### Account Deletion Flow
```
User deletes account → authController.deleteAccount()
├── MongoDB: JournalEntry.deleteMany() ✅
├── MongoDB: ChatSession.deleteMany() ✅  
├── MongoDB: MemorySnapshot.deleteMany() ✅
├── Pinecone: deleteUserVectorsFromPinecone(userId) ✅
└── MongoDB: User.findByIdAndDelete() ✅
```

#### Entry Deletion Flow
```
User deletes entry → journalController.deleteEntry()
├── MongoDB: JournalEntry.findOneAndDelete() ✅
├── Pinecone: deleteVectorByEntryId(entryId) ✅
└── Response: Success confirmation ✅
```
